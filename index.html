            programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. ... Visual Studio includes a code editor

            A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the 
            output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a 
            console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.
